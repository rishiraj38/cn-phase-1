# TLS Certificate Setup Notes (Task E)

## What we built

A tiny **private certificate authority (CA)** of our own, plus one **server certificate** for `app.teamx.test` and `api.teamx.test` that the CA signed. nginx on Mac 2 presents that certificate. Every client Mac adds our CA to its trust store once. After that, the browser and curl accept the server **with full validation, and no `-k` anywhere**.

```
 Team X Local Root CA   (ca.crt / ca.key)      ← trusted by every client Mac
          │ signs
          ▼
 app.teamx.test         (server.crt / server.key)  ← nginx sends this in the handshake
   SAN: DNS:app.teamx.test, DNS:api.teamx.test
```

## Commands (all wrapped in `tls/make-certs.sh`)

```bash
# 1. CA key + self-signed CA certificate (CA:TRUE, can sign certs)
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -key ca.key -sha256 -days 825 -out ca.crt -config ca.ext

# 2. Server key + certificate signing request
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key server.key -subj "/CN=app.teamx.test" -out server.csr

# 3. CA signs the CSR, adding SAN + serverAuth
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out server.crt -days 397 -sha256 -extfile server.ext

# 4. Check
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt server.crt      # → server.crt: OK
```

Why these exact options? Modern macOS (and Chrome) refuse a server certificate that:
- has no **Subject Alternative Name**. The CN alone is ignored nowadays.
- lacks **Extended Key Usage = serverAuth**
- is valid for **more than 825 days** (we use 397)

## nginx side

```nginx
listen 443 ssl;  http2 on;
ssl_certificate     tls/out/server-chain.crt;   # server cert + CA cert
ssl_certificate_key tls/out/server.key;
ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
```

## Client side (trust the CA)

```bash
scripts/trust-ca.sh
# = curl http://app.teamx.test/ca.crt -o tls/out/ca.crt
#   compare SHA-256 fingerprint with the one Mac 2 printed   ← stops a fake CA
#   sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain tls/out/ca.crt
```

Safari and Chrome use the macOS keychain, so they trust it right away (restart the browser). Firefox has its own store: Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → Import.
If a curl build doesn't read the keychain, our scripts pass `--cacert tls/out/ca.crt`. That is still **complete** verification against our CA. It's the opposite of `-k`, which turns verification off.

**Undo after the project:** `scripts/trust-ca.sh remove`

## What "certificate validation" actually checks

1. The server's certificate chain leads up to a CA that is in **my** trust store (our root CA).
2. Each signature in the chain is valid, so nobody altered the certificate.
3. The name I typed (`app.teamx.test`) appears in the certificate's SAN list.
4. Today's date is inside the validity period.
5. The server proves it owns the matching **private key** by signing the handshake (CertificateVerify in TLS 1.3, ServerKeyExchange in TLS 1.2). Copying `server.crt` alone is useless without `server.key`.

If you type the IP (`https://192.168.1.12`), check 3 fails because the IP isn't in the SAN. That's one more reason the demo always uses the name.

## The handshake (what we point at in Wireshark)

TLS 1.2 (what `scripts/capture.sh` uses by default, because every step is visible):

| # | Direction | Message | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | C → S | **ClientHello** | TLS versions, cipher suites, random, **SNI = app.teamx.test**, ALPN = h2,http/1.1 |
| 2 | S → C | **ServerHello** | Picked version + cipher + ALPN, server random |
| 3 | S → C | **Certificate** | server.crt + ca.crt. The client validates it now. |
| 4 | S → C | ServerKeyExchange | ECDHE public key, **signed** with server.key |
| 5 | S → C | ServerHelloDone | |
| 6 | C → S | ClientKeyExchange | Client's ECDHE public key. Both sides now compute the same secret. |
| 7 | C → S | **ChangeCipherSpec** + Finished | "Everything I send from now on is encrypted" |
| 8 | S → C | **ChangeCipherSpec** + Finished | Same from the server. Handshake complete. |
| 9 | both | **Application Data** | The HTTP request/response, encrypted |

TLS 1.3 (what browsers use normally) has 1 round trip instead of 2. Everything after ServerHello, **including the Certificate**, is already encrypted, so Wireshark shows it as "Application Data" unless you load the key log file (`evidence/pcap/sslkeys-*.log`).
